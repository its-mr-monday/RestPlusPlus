 1 . Add a system for dynamic routes
  + Example we create a dynamic route: /api/v1/<user>/posts/<post_id>/comments/<comment_id>
  + Lets say they pass in: /api/v1/rickjames/posts/11233/comments/e11012/121
  + We would parse the following map as so:
  {
    "user": "rickjames",
    "post_id": "11233",
    "comment_id": "e11012/121"
  }
  + This would be set as the HTTPRequest params object
  + We could then access these values in C++ by calling the params objects methods
  + Example:
    + params.get("user") -> "rickjames"
    + params.get("post_id") -> "11233"
    + params.get("comment_id") -> "e11012/121"
